This is a small project done as part of the [HPDF](https://blog.hasura.io/the-hasura-product-development-fellowship-a314fa63e5f9) program by Hasura. 

The objective of this project is to create a simple, standalone replica of the first few screens of the UI of the default Twitter app for android using React Native and NativeBase UI.

This project was bootstrapped with [CRNA](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

##Requirements

You must have npm version 4+ and NodeJS version 6+ installed in your system.

Set up Android SDK and AVD as mentioned in the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRLLjlpy0r4) is a great video tutorial on the same by Traversy Media on YouTube.

Install CRNA and [NativeBase](https://docs.nativebase.io/docs/GetStarted.html) for projects created with CRNA.

Download and install the [Expo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en) in your android device for instant previewing with hot reload supported.

##How to get it running

Clone this repository and run `npm init`. Once npm downloads the dependecies run `npm start`, then either scan the QR code generated or enter the URL shown into the search bar of your Expo app.
